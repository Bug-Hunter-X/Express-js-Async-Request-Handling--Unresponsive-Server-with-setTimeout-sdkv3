# Express.js Async Request Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js applications where asynchronous operations, if not handled correctly, can lead to server unresponsiveness.  The bug involves using `setTimeout` within a request handler, causing a delay before the response is sent.  This can result in client-side timeouts and a poor user experience.

## Bug Description

The provided `bug.js` file contains an Express.js server that handles POST requests to the `/data` endpoint.  The server simulates an asynchronous operation using `setTimeout` to introduce a 5-second delay before processing the request and sending a response.  This delay can lead to significant performance degradation and perceived server unresponsiveness.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file offers a solution that addresses this issue by using promises or async/await to handle asynchronous operations gracefully. This ensures that the server remains responsive during the processing, preventing timeouts and improving overall performance.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Run `node bug.js` to start the server with the bug.
5. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/data` with some JSON data. Observe the delay in the response.
6. Run `node bugSolution.js` to start the server with the solution and repeat step 5 to see the improved responsiveness.
